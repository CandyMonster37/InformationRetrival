(Sigh)...So he calls me up, and he's like, "I still love you," and
I'm like, I mean this is exhausting. You know, like we are never getting back together. Like, ever.
We are never ever ever... getting back together
We are never ever ever... getting back together
You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me
But we are never ever ever ever... getting back together
We, ooh... getting back together
We, ooh... getting back together
You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me
But we are never ever ever ever... getting back together
