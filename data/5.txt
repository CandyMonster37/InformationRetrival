Ooh, we called it off again last night but
Ooh, this time I'm telling you, I'm telling you...
We are never ever ever... getting back together
We are never ever ever... getting back together
You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me
But we are never ever ever ever... getting back together
Like, ever.
I'm really gonna miss you picking fights
And me falling for it, screaming that I'm right
And you would hide away and find your peace of mind
With some indie record that's much cooler than mine
